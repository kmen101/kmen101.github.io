          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>A series of trading states developed in the area of Zimbabwe prior to the arrival of the first European explorers; the largest of these was the Kingdom of Zimbabwe (<abbr title="circa">ca.</abbr> <time datetime="1220">1220</time>-<time datetime="1450">1450</time>). In the 1880s, European colonists arrived with the British South Africa Company (<abbr title="British South Africa Company">BSAC</abbr>), which obtained mining rights and established company rule over the area. The southern portion of BSAC holdings were annexed by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> in <time datetime="1923">1923</time> and became the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.</p>

          <p>A <time datetime="1961">1961</time> constitution was formulated that favored whites in power. In <time datetime="1965">1965</time> the government unilaterally declared its independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in <time datetime="1979">1979</time> and independence (as Zimbabwe) in <time datetime="1980">1980</time>.</p>

          <p>Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, was the country's only ruler (as president since <time datetime="1987">1987</time>) from independence until his resignation in <time datetime="2017-11">November 2017</time>. His chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in <time datetime="1997">1997</time> and intensified after <time datetime="2000">2000</time>, caused an exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation, MUGABE rigged the <time datetime="2002">2002</time> presidential election to ensure his reelection.</p>

          <p>In <time datetime="2005">2005</time>, the capital city of Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of the homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition. MUGABE in <time datetime="2007">2007</time> instituted price controls on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store shelves empty for months.</p>

          <p>General elections in both <time datetime="2008">2008</time> and <time datetime="2013">2013</time> were severely flawed and widely condemned, but allowed MUGABE to remain president. As a prerequisite to holding the <time datetime="2013">2013</time> election, Zimbabwe enacted a new constitution by referendum, although many provisions in the new constitution have yet to be codified in law.</p>

          <p>In <time datetime="2017-11">November 2017</time>, Vice President Emmerson MNANGAGWA took over following a military intervention that forced MUGABE to resign. MNANGAGWA was inaugurated president days later, promising to hold presidential elections in <time datetime="2018">2018</time>. In <time datetime="2018-07">July 2018</time>, MNANGAGWA won the presidential election after a close contest with Movement for Democratic Change Alliance candidate Nelson CHAMISA.</p>

          <p>MNANGAGWA has since resorted to the government's longstanding practice of violently disrupting protests or opposition rallies. Official inflation rates soared in <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, approaching 500% by the end of the year. MUGABE died in <time datetime="2019-09">September 2019</time>.</p>
