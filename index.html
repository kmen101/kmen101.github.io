    <!-- Info about me -->
    <h3>This is my first webpage!</h3>
    <p>However, I actually studied HTML and CSS way back in my sophopmore <br>
      year of high school. I haven't truly had some experience with it since <br>
      about 2015, but this it's amazing what you can remember. Taking this <br>
      class is almost like a refresh for me. I remember I loved learning html it <br>
      was honestly the class that inspired be to become a computer science major.
