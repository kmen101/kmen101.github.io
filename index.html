          <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

          <p>My name is Kyle Mendelson and welcome to my website! I was born on May 24, 1999 in Gaithersburg, Maryland. I atteneded both Thomas S. Wootton High School and Bullis School. I graduated from Bullis in May of 2017 and then headed to the University of Miami. Before I arrived I applied to graduate with a degree in Computer Science. Growing up I was always fascinated by technology. My freshman year of high school I took my first ever coding course called design technology solutions, or <abbr title="Design Technology Solutions">DTS</abbr>. This was my first experience with Java and from then on I knew I was going to be coding for years to come.</p>

          <p>When I arrived in Miami, I picked up a minor in Business Technology after taking a few courses and falling in love with the business side of the tech world. Continuing through college, I found myself fascinated with data and knew that was the market I wanted to dive into. I decided to try my best to transform my major to be focused on data. As I prepare to enter "the real world," I'm so excited for what's to come.</p>

          <p>Throughout college I've had incredible real life experiences. Beginning in January of 2019 I became the Merchandise Chair of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. The summer between my junior and senior year I worked as a Data Engineering intern for Consumer Edge. In August 2020 I became an Insights Analyst for Orange Umbrella, a completely student run consulting firm. Through Orange Umbrella I had the incredible opportunity to work at Super Bowl LIV in Miami as a Social Media intern. </p>
