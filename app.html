          <h2>Introducing Earmark</h2>
          <p>During the second semester of my junior year at the University of Miami I took a software engineering course. The class consisted of forming groups and in the end having a functional piece of software.</p>

          <p>My group decided to create an app named Earmark. Earmark is a budgeting app which can be linked to your bank account. The main purpose of the application is to keep track of upcoming bills and notify the user of bill cycle dates so that you never miss a bill again. The application will also be able to keep track of the userâ€™s balance so that the user can be notified if there are not sufficient funds for an upcoming bill. Some extra functions are that the app could keep track of spending habits and can help the user save money by keeping track of monthly spending patterns and provide budgeting recommendations.</p>

          <p>The app was designed using JavaScript accompanied with React Native in order to ensure the UI could be compatible on both iOS and Android devices. Node JS was used in coding the apps components, along with SQL to have a client-to-server interaction for data storage. Adobe XD was used for design and Adobe Illustrator for the logo and icons.</p>
