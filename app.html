          <h2>Introducing Earmark</h2>
          <p>During the second semester of my junior year at the University of Miami I took a software engineering course. The class consisted of forming groups and in the end having a functional piece of software.</p>

          <p>My group decided to create an app named Earmark. Earmark is a budgeting app which can be linked to your bank account. The main purpose of the application is to keep track of upcoming bills and notify the user of bill cycle dates so that you never miss a bill again. The application will also be able to keep track of the userâ€™s balance so that the user can be notified if there are not sufficient funds for an upcoming bill. Some extra functions are that the app could keep track of spending habits and can help the user save money by keeping track of monthly spending patterns and provide budgeting recommendations.</p>

          <p>The app was designed using JavaScript accompanied with React Native in order to ensure the UI could be compatible on both iOS and Android devices. Node JS was used in coding the apps components, along with SQL to have a client-to-server interaction for data storage. Adobe XD was used for design and Adobe Illustrator for the logo and icons.</p>

        <p>The first video shown here is a demo of creating an account and setting it up on the Earmark app. It begins with entering your name, email address, and password and then you are prompted to connect that account to your bank account using Plaid which ensures it's secure and private.</p>

        <p>Next, you are prompted with a few questions so that the app can understand you a little bit better. These questions include: what is your monthly income, what are your monthly static costs, and how much money would you like to save each month? After your budget is set you are prompted with sliders to allocate certain amount of your money to specific things. Once this is all complete you can see how much money you have!</p>

        <p>The second video simply shows someone logging back into their previously created account.</p>

        <p>This video shows a preview of every page we created within the Earmark app. In order to navigate between pages there is a bar at the bottom with different icons.The app opens on the home screen which dsiplays your current budget in addition to a button that allows you to easily add a bill. If you had any, it would also say on this page any bills that you still need to pay.</p>

        <p>When you click on the icon to the right, you are taken to the activity page. Here, you can see all of the bills you have paid. Additionally, you can also add more bills/subscriptions and manage how you previously allocated your budget.<p>

        <p>Continuing you will get to the analytics page of the app. Here you can look at your current budget and track what you are spending your money on. You can also look at previous months to compare your spending breakdowns.</p>

        <p>The next page is your account. Here you can add or manage the current bank accounts you have connected to the app. This includes credit cards, IRAs, 401ks and more.</p>

        <p>Finally, we have the settings page. This page is pretty standard, but incredibly important. Here you can edit your name and email address, edit the types of notifications you get, and finally get help if needed. We worked incredibly hard on this app to create a finance app that holds everything in one place. All of your money, all of your subscriptions, everything you could possibly need to know about your finances all together.</p>
